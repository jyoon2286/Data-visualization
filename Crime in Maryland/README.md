# Project name
Crime in Maryland

# Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was curious about how safe to live in Maryland. I had
a question about “Our governor or counties are working on to decrease
the crime rate?” or “How has improvement it been made to be a safe
country, state, county, or town since 1996 or 1997?” My target audience is
any students who want to know this specific topic, people who are looking
for a safe county to move, and UMD students. I use infographic because it
will be easy to understand to kids or low-grade students up to adults. My
infographic has four sections which are nationwide perspective, statewide
perspective, countrywide perspective, and town. I was trying to talk from
big and large data or topic to small data or topic.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I download datasets, clean, and analyze the data before I open them up in
Tableau. I mainly look for the violent crime rate and property crime rate
instead of individual crimes because I want to give my audience a broad
idea rather than details since I am creating an infographic. I calculated the
percentage of decrease rate by total data. I try to minimize the color in
three or four, which are orange, yellow, black, and white because I want to
have some more attention in some part. I also add many pictures, icons,
and graph and maize the text because it is an infographic, not a journal or
article.

# Data
I got this data from Kaggle for first two data and from the website of governor’s office of
crime control & prevention for MD data.
