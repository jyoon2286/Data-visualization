# Project name
An Infographic about the crime rate in Maryland county and UMD

# Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was curious about how safe to live in Maryland. I had a question about “Our governor or counties are working on decreasing the crime rate?” or “How has improvement been made to be a safe country, state, county, or town since 1996 or 1997?” My target audience is any students who want to know this specific topic, people who are looking for a safe county to move to, and UMD students. I use an infographic because it will be easy to understand for kids or low-grade students up to adults. My infographic has four sections which are nationwide perspective, statewide perspective, countrywide perspective, and town. I was trying to talk from big and large data or topics to small data or topics.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I download datasets, clean them, and analyze the data before I open them up in Tableau. I mainly look for the violent crime rate and property crime rate instead of individual crimes because I want to give my audience a broad idea rather than details since I am creating an infographic. I calculated the percentage of decrease rate by total data. I try to minimize the color to three or four, which are orange, yellow, black, and white because I want to have more attention to some parts. I also add many pictures, icons, and graphs and maize the text because it is an infographic, not a journal or article.


# Data
I got this data from Kaggle for first two data and from the website of governor’s office of
